Information:
=============

First line in your script will be a Shebang character hash exclamation. That's one character Shebang that really gives or 
tells the path of the interpretive.

So what basically we're telling the script when it executes is that open this interpreter and execute

all the commands that I'm writing on that interpreter, if it happens to be a Python script, you'll have the path of Python 
interpreter. If it's Ruby, you'll have ruby interpreter.
