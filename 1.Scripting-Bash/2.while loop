A while loop is a statement that iterates over a block of code till the condition specified is evaluated to true. 
We can use this statement or loop in our program when do not know how many times the condition is going to evaluate to 
false before evaluating to true.  

syntax 
================================================

while [ condition ];
do
    # statements
    # commands
done  

================================================
If the condition is false then the commands inside the while block are executed and are iterated again after checking 
the condition. 

Also if the condition is true the statements inside the while block are skipped and the statements after the while block 
are executed. 

The example of a while loop is as follows:

#!/usr/bin/bash 

a=7
while [ $a -gt 4 ];
do
    echo $a
    ((a--))
done

echo "Out of the loop"

=============================== Reading a file with a while loop   ===========================

We can read a file with a while loop in BASH.  By parsing certain parameters to the while loop condition, 
we can iterate over the file line by line or by other groups like characters or words.

#!/usr/bin/bash 

file=temp.txt

while read -r line;
do
    echo $line
done < "$file


We use the command read to actually fetch the lines or characters from the file. The read command is passed with 
-r argument which ignores the escaping of characters if the \  appears and hence it is parsed as its.  
We read a line from a file mentioned after the done statement. The read command reads a line from the mentioned file and 
the while loops end when the last line from the file is read ( no line is left to read).
