If the file exist and we just say, the file exists, that means the process is running and httpd is running.
Else we will say the process is not running and it will start the process.


Here how to check httpd up or donw

#ls /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid
/var/run/httpd/httpd.pid                        #if file exists means httpd is up and running

#ls /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid                    #if not exist means httpd is down
#ls: cannot access /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid: No such file or directory 

======================================== SCRIPT =======================================================

#!/bin/bash

ls /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
  echo "httpd process is running"
else
  echo "Httpd process is not running"
  echo "Start the process"
  systemctl start httpd

  if [ $? -eq 0 ]
  then
   echo "Process started successfully"
  else
   echo "Process starting failed , contact admin"
  fi

fi

================================ Execute script =============================

# sh s1.sh
/var/run/httpd/httpd.pid
httpd process is running

stop the process and check script will start httpd or not 

#systemctl stop httpd
#systemctl status httpd
exited

execute script:
-----------------
#sh s1.sh

ls: cannot access /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid: No such file or directory
Httpd process is not running
Start the process
Process started successfully

================================ ================================

Here we have stopped httpd , so it checks ls /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid  (once it stop that file will not exist) so that 
command will fail.

echo $? value is nonzero so it move to else process. In else process having below details to start httpd

  echo "Httpd process is not running"
  echo "Start the process"
  systemctl start httpd
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]
  
  
if we have started process but may be it will up or down or failed the command , so it check echo $? it provides 0 means 
httpd process is up  otherwise it will be down.



==================================== EXPLANATION ==============================================================  \

Command is failing the exit code "$?" value should be non-zero.  echo $?    ie non zero

But if the command works, its exit code should be zero.  0 means true in bash scripting, and non-zero means false.

systemctl status httpd The process is running.  whenever there is a process running, there will be PID file that will get created.
So if httpd is running, there should be a PID file for it.

#yum install httpd -y
#systemctl status httpd 
running

#if file exists means httpd running and will give PID for this . if not running /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid will not exists( no such file or directory)
if httpd up it shows some pid

[root@ip-172-31-10-46 httpd]# systemctl status httpd
   Active: active (running) 

#cat /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid              # if process is running it will show directory and its id otherwise it show "not exist" 
2206

echo $?                                    # means previous or last command is executed successfully.
0

/var/run/httpd/httpd.pid

httpd.pid, this file will contain the process ID,   but if the process is dead, Then that file will cease to exist.  
You see no such file or directory. 

Now, if we get no such file or directory,  then the "$?" value will be non zero. so let's start the httpd process first.  PID file appears

lets stop process and see :
============================
#systemctl stop httpd

# cat /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid
cat: /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid: No such file or directory

Here command failed so check using echo $? will provide non zero (means last commnad is failed)

#echo $?
1
