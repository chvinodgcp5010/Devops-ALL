Basic Operators in Shell Scripting

There are 5 basic operators in bash/shell scripting:

Arithmetic Operators
Relational Operators
Boolean Operators
Bitwise Operators
File Test Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators: These operators are used to perform normal arithmetics/mathematical operations. There are 7 arithmetic operators:

Addition (+): Binary operation used to add two operands.
Subtraction (-): Binary operation used to subtract two operands.
Multiplication (*): Binary operation used to multiply two operands.
Division (/): Binary operation used to divide two operands.
Modulus (%): Binary operation used to find remainder of two operands.
Increment Operator (++): Unary operator used to increase the value of operand by one.
Decrement Operator (- -): Unary operator used to decrease the value of a operand by one


vi arith.sh
-------------

read -p "Enter a : " a
read -p "Enter b : " b
add=$((a+b))                           #value = $((a+b))  invalid no space needed while allocating variable to value.
echo "addition of and b are" $add
sub=$((a-b)) 
echo "addition of and b are" $sub
mul=$((a*b)) 
echo "addition of and b are" $mul
div=$((a/b)) 
echo "addition of and b are" $div
mod=$((a%b)) 
echo "addition of and b are" $mod
((++a))
echo increment operator a=$a
((--b))
echo decrement operator b=$b


sh s1.sh

Enter a : 23
Enter b : 24
addition of and b are 47
addition of and b are -1
addition of and b are 552
addition of and b are 0
addition of and b are 23
increment operator a=24
decrement operator b=23
