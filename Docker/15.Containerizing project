First we're going to write docker file for the services that need customized sowe have Nginx, Tomcat and MySQL. 

So we have to write 3 docker files once we have written docker file in our source code then we are going to use a "docker build" command 
which will get executed on our docker engine.

In our docker file we should have mentioned the base image.This "base images" will be pulled from Docker Hub
so Tomcat, Nginx and MySQL these are three images that we are going to pull and customize them.
So docker build command is going to read the docker file, build our image.

Once our images are ready we're going to use a docker compose, we'll mention all the containers with the images 
and then we are going to test it.

Once it checks out fine then we are going to push our docker images, the customized docker images to Docker Hub in our own account 
so that's the entire docker workflow that we are going to do.

Source(Dockerfile) --->Build (Docker build) -->test (docker compose) --->Store (docker push) (dockerhub)

So I'm on GitHub on our repository vprofile project I'm on branch "local-setup" in this branch there is a vagrant directory and we have 
manual provisioning and there's a PDF to set up our services.


============================================= FLOW ===============================================

PROVISIONING
Services
1. Nginx:
Web Service
2. Tomcat
Application Server
3. RabbitMQ
Broker/Queuing Agent
4. Memcache
DB Caching
5. ElasticSearch
Indexing/Search service
6. MySQL
SQL Database


Setup should be done in below mentioned order
1. MySQL (Database SVC)
2. Memcache (DB Caching SVC)
3. RabbitMQ (Broker/Queue SVC)
4. Tomcat (Application SVC)
5. Nginx (Web SVC)


======================================= tomcat dockerfile===============================
Build docker

dockerfile reference:
----------------------
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

tomcat image (docker hub path)

https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat

Dockerfile
------------

FROM tomcat:8-jre8
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapss/*
COPY targte/vprofile-v2.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
VOLUME /usr/local/tomcat/webapps



======================================= DB(Mysql) dockerfile===============================

https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql?tab=tags

For this we'll be using MySQL. MySQL tag five,six, or five seven we can use, not eight. It doesn't work with our application.
So we can go with five dot seven if we can also go with five dot. Six

Dockerfile
------------

FROM mysql:5.7.25
ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="vprodbpass"
ENV MYSQL_DATABASE="accounts"

ADD db_backup.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/db_backup.sql



======================================= Nginx dockerfile===============================

Dockerfile
-------------

FROM nginx
LABEL "Project"="Vprofile"
LABEL "Author"="User"
RUN rm -rf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY nginxvproapp.conf  /etc/nginx/conf.d/vproapp.conf


nvvproapp.conf
-------------

upstream vproapp{
 server vproapp:8080;
}
server {
  listen 80;
location / {
  proxy_pass http://vproapp;
 }
}
