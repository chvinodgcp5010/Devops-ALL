microservice and how it is is very good in software development and delivering features to the users quickly and efficiently.

microservice architecture is here and it is going to stay for a very long time.
And being a DevOps, you will definitely witness micro service application and you should know first how to containerize it.

So,


Block diagram:
================

API Gateway (Nginx) -------------------> / -------------------> client(Angular)
                    ------------------->/api -----------------> emart api (nodejs) ------>mongo db
                    ------------------->/books --------------->books api (java) ---------> Mysql DB
                    
                    
We have four services here.

NGINX, which is the API gateway, which is the front end from where all the request comes. And all the communication between 
micrservices happen through this API gateway.This will be an nginx service which willlisten for the request and route based on
the headers, based on the URLs.

So if the request comes on a route, that is if you're just accessing the URL, then it sends to
the client microservice which is written in angular.So this loads the front end pages of the website.
And for back end data it is going to contact the API service "emart API" which is written in NodeJS
and the URL will be "/API" and NodeJS application.These APIs will need database.And here we are using MongoDB, a NoSQL database.


There is also one more integration
of another service, books API.And this is written in Java.It uses my SQL database, which is an SQL database and it's URLs WebAPI.
So this is an ecommerce application which has multiple microservice.
