FROM                          : Specity base image take from dockerhub (take base image and on top of that do customization)
LABELS                        : like key and value pairs  => add metadata to an image (like tags in aws) 
                                like project name and "author name"
RUN                           : Instruct going to make changes (install a package or create a directory)
                                whatever the command you want to execute or make changes that we mention through RUN instruction.
ADD/COPY                      : COPY/ADD files and folders in to image while you are building (like config file and archive)

                       ADD: you can provide link an archive ,it can download from a link and put in image or it can unarchive.
                       COPY: take a file and dump it 

CMD                           : Run binaries/command when docker run . (will set "what binary is executed when docker run")
ENTRYPOINT                    : Similar to CMD but it have "higher priority" . if you mention both together you can mention
                                command in "ENTRYPOINT" and Argument to that command using "CMD"
                                Allows you to configure an container that will run as executable.
