Developer(GIT) -->GITHUB -> GIT (Fetch code) -> maven (unit test) -> sonarqube (code analysis) -> quality gate -> Docker build (Artifacts) 
-> ECR (Image store) ---> ( Deploy )Amazon ECS ( elastic container service)


ECS 
ECS fetch docker images (latest) that we publish and host on ECS.

Docker hosting platforms:
--------------------------
1. Docker engine:

docker run <image name>

very much testing and local development env not for prod --> we need to manage underlining platforms

high availabilty will not achieve.

--> Kubernetes is required for production.

Kubernetes:
standalone , EKS , GKE , Openshift etc.


ECS: (elastic container service)
==================================

Amazon ECS makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale Docker containers running applications, services, and batch processes. 
Amazon ECS places containers across your cluster based on your resource needs and is integrated with familiar features like Elastic Load Balancing, 
EC2 security groups, EBS volumes and.

runs higly secure , reliable and scalable containers.

Run containers at scale	Flexible container placement	Integrated and extensible

Amazon ECS makes it easy to use containers as a foundational building block for your applications by eliminating the need for you to install, 
operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure.
