Jenkins master executes build job on node it selected.

Cross platform builds:
----------------------
Execute build on other platforrms like .net ( windows ) ,ios ( mac )from jenkins master (linux)

Software testing:
-----------------
execute testers test from automation script

You can add any computer in n/w as jenkins node and execute commands on node.

eg: scripts, commands ,test scripts etc


===================================== Pre-requisite for node setup ==============================================

1.Any os
2.n/w access from master ( firewall rules)
3.java jre ,jdk
4.user
5.directory with user ownership
6.tools required by the jenkins job
maven ,ant ,git



1. Create Vm

master as of now (ubuntu)
creating slave same as (ubuntu18)

2.create new security group:
slave-1

ssh 22  source (myip) and save
ssh 22  source (master jenkins security group)


review and launch


3. login to slave VM

1.apt update && apt install openjdk-8-jdk maven -y

2.add user:

->root@ip-172-31-26-220:~# adduser devops
Adding user `devops' ...
Adding new group `devops' (1001) ...
Adding new user `devops' (1001) with group `devops' ...
Creating home directory `/home/devops' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
->Enter new UNIX password: devops
->Retype new UNIX password: devops
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for devops
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []:
        Room Number []:
        Work Phone []:
        Home Phone []:
        Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]

3.create directory for workspace and provide devops.devops as roles to directory

mkdir /opt/jenkins-slave

->add ownershipt to directory as ->devops.devops 

chown -R devops.devops /opt/jenkins-slave


4.From jenkins master we are conecting to slaves using "ssh"
by default aws ami linux password based access is disabled

->vi /ets/ssh/sshd_config

line number(56) update from no to yes and restart ssh

PasswordAuthentication  yes 

->service sshd restart
or
->systemctl restart sshd


5. Jenkins Master --->ssh --> slave  ( using pwd based authentication ) so we created user devops 

On MASTER:

Manage Jenkins -> Manage node and clouds ->click on "new node" 
Nodename       -> slave  ->permanent agent --> create

Number of executors:     5                   ( you can add any)
Remote root directory:  /opt/jenkins-slave   ( created on slave )
Labels:                 gold
Usage:                  use this node as much as possible
Launch method :         launch agent via ssh

Host:                172.31.26.220                                   ( jenkins slave private ip )
Credentials:    add -> jenkins ->username and password 
Username:            devops                                           (created in slave vm)
password :           devops
ID:                  jenkins-slave
Host Key Verification Strategy:   non verifying verification strategy

Jenkins will access to ssh to node (it will not answer yes /no to connect ) so use "non verifying verification strategy"

Availability :        keep this node as much as possible

Click on : SAVE


================
click on save node (x mode by default)

click on "launch agent"

Built-In Node	Linux (amd64)	In sync
slave3	Linux (amd64)	 	In sync


if you not enabled "password authetication" to yes it through an error

After enabling  "PasswordAuthentication  yes "

->vi /ets/ssh/sshd_config

line number(56) update from no to yes and restart ssh

PasswordAuthentication  yes 


Once click on "launch agent" it show node as online

=================================== CREATE A JOB ON MASTER AND CHECK IF IT EXECUTE ON SLAVE OR NOT =============================================

USE : on slave mentioned as 
"use this node as much as possible"

so mostly it trigger slave node instead of master

Job: pipeline


========================================-Jenkinsfile:================================================


pipeline {
  agent any 
  stages {
    stage ('fetch the code'){
      steps {
        git branch: 'paac', url: 'https://github.com/chvinodgcp5010/CICD-project-Nexus-and-Sonarqube.git' 
      }
    }
    stage ('build code'){
      steps {
        sh 'mvn install'
      }
    }
    stage ('test code'){
      steps {
        sh 'mvn test'
       }
    }
  }
}

---------------------------------------------------

trigger few builds and check it is executing on slave node or not


check the build output:

->Still waiting to schedule task
Waiting for next available executor
Running on """slave1""" in /opt/jenkins-slave/workspace/pipeline-gspann

check workspace on slave:

cd /opt/jenkins-slave/workspace/pipeline-gspann

root@ip-172-31-26-220:/opt/jenkins-slave/workspace/pipeline-gspann# ls
