By default we installed jenkins , maven using below commnads.

"apt install openjdk-8-jdk"
"apt install maven -y"

So jenkins will take these path and execute directly from "system installation" ( directly installed from cli )

================================ GLOBAL TOOL CONFIGURATIONS ====================================

If suppose if we have multiple versions of java and maven you need specific version to execute on specific build from there we need to 
use "global tool configuration" 

OR
If we want to install dirctly from jenkins user interface use "global tool configurations" page and add install automtically .

================================================================================================

Try to remove maven using "apt remove maven -y" and execute build it will fail , because there is no maven 

Caused: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "mvn" (in directory "/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/first-view"): error=2, No such file or directory

============================= instead of using system level tools while installing manually install automatically from jenkins UI ==============

if you install from VM and add other version from global tool configuration it will take from global tool only. we need to give mvn name to the job otherwise it
will take the system installed versions.

1. updated mvn version install automatically from jenkins to 3.8.5 and name it as "maven-3.8.5"
2. added mvn name in to the build job.

execute the build.

logs:

/var/lib/jenkins/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/mvn on Jenkins
[first-view] $ /var/lib/jenkins/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/maven-3.8.5/bin/mvn install


PREVIOUS: without global tool config (install from vm)

[first-view] $ mvn install


NOTE:

If you install automatically from Jenkins you will get console output on jenkins like below.

The recommended git tool is: NONE                     ( here git not using from automatically)
[first-view] $ /var/lib/jenkins/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/maven-3.8.5/bin/mvn clean install   (maven added from jenkins automatically)

if you use tools automatically it will be in tools directory.
