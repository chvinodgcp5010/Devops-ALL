By default we installed jenkins , maven using 
"apt install openjdk-8-jdk"
"apt install maven -y"

so jenkins will take these path and execute directly from "system installation" ( directly installed from cli )

================================ global tool configurations ====================================

If suppose if we have multiple versions of java and maven you need specific version to execute on specific build from there we need to 
use "global tool configuration" 

OR
If we want to install dirctly from jenkins user interface use "global tool configurations" page and add install automtically .

================================================================================================

Try to remove maven using "apt remove maven -y" and execute build it will fail , because there is no maven 

Caused: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "mvn" (in directory "/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/first-view"): error=2, No such file or directory
