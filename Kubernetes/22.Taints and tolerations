Taint and tolerations

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/

Node affinity is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes (either as a preference or a hard requirement). 
Taints are the opposite -- they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

Tolerations are applied to pods. Tolerations allow the scheduler to schedule pods with matching taints. Tolerations allow scheduling
but don't guarantee scheduling: the scheduler also evaluates other parameters as part of its function.

You add a taint to a node using kubectl taint. For example,

kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
places a taint on node node1. The taint has key key1, value value1, and taint effect NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able
to schedule onto node1 unless it has a matching toleration.

To remove the taint added by the command above, you can run:

kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-

You specify a toleration for a pod in the PodSpec. Both of the following tolerations "match" the taint created by the kubectl taint
line above, and thus a pod with either toleration would be able to schedule onto node1:

You specify a toleration for a pod in the PodSpec. Both of the following tolerations "match" the taint created by the kubectl taint 
line above, and thus a pod with either toleration would be able to schedule onto node1:

tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
  
  
  
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
  
    
=====================

Here's an example of a pod that uses tolerations:


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "example-key"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
    
  
The default value for operator is Equal.

A toleration "matches" a taint if the keys are the same and the effects are the same, and:

the operator is Exists (in which case no value should be specified), or
the operator is Equal and the values are equal.
