--format=json": err=exec: "/usr/lib/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud": file does not exist output= stderr=

Fixed this by just updating the cmd-path to just gcloud (cmd-path: gcloud)

Here is the kubeconfig snippet for reference:

      auth-provider:
        config:
          cmd-args: config config-helper --format=json
