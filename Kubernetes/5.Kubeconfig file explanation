Kubeconfig:
===========

Organizing Cluster Access Using kubeconfig Files

->Use kubeconfig files to organize information about ""clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication mechanisms"".

->The kubectl command-line tool uses kubeconfig files to find the information it needs to choose a cluster and communicate with the API 
server of a cluster.

Note: A file that is used to configure access to clusters is called a kubeconfig file. This is a generic way of referring to 
configuration files. It does not mean that there is a file named kubeconfig.
